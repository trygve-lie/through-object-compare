[![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/trygve-lie/through-object-compare.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/trygve-lie/through-object-compare)[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/trygve-lie/through-object-compare/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/trygve-lie/through-object-compare)


Transform stream that compare each object in the stream with objects in an array 
of objects to find differences. The intention is to find differences and flag
objects we compare as "added", "changed" or "deleted".



## Installation

```bash
$ npm install through-object-compare
```



## Example

Compare an object stream based on a created and updated timestamp in each 
object.

```js

const throughObjectCompare = require('through-object-compare'),
	  JSONStream = require('JSONStream')
      fs = require('fs');


// Compare function which compare timestamp fields in each object

const compareFunction = (objOld, objNew) => {
    return objOld.updated === objNew.updated && objOld.created === objNew.created;
};


// The array of objects we compare the stream against

const arrayOfObjects = [{
    uuid : '001',
    created : 1,
    updated : 1
}, {
    uuid : '002',
    created : 2,
    updated : 20
}, {
    uuid : '003',
    created : 3,
    updated : 3
}];


fs.createReadStream('objects.json')
  .pipe(JSONStream.parse('*'))
  .pipe(throughObjectCompare(arrayOfObjects, compareFunction))
  .pipe(JSONStream.stringify())
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('comparedObjects.json'));
```



## Description

The intention of this module is to compare two sets of objects and find what is
different between them. This is done by holding an array of objects and then 
check each object in a stream against this array.

The output of the stream will then emit objects which each are flagged as 
"added", "changed" or "deleted".

The only requirement is that each object we compare has an unique identifier 
key.



## API

This module have the following API:

### throughObjectCompare(compareArray, compareFunction)

Creates an instance for comparing.

```js
const throughObjectCompare = require('through-object-compare');
let compare = throughObjectCompare(compareArray, compareFunction);
```


### compareArray (required)

An array of objects to compare the objects in the stream against.


### compareFunction

A compare function used to compare two matching objects based on a unique 
identifier key in the objects. Must return true or false.

The first argument parameter on the function is an object from the compareArray. 
The second argument parameter to the function is the current object in the 
stream.

```js
let compare = throughObjectCompare(compareArray, (objOld, objNew) => {
    return objOld.updated === objNew.updated && objOld.created === objNew.created;
});
```



## Events

through-object-compare expose expose the following events. 


### append

Emitted when a object occur in the stream which are not in the array of objects
compared against.

```js
compare.on('append', function (obj) {
    console.log('appended', obj);
});
```


### change

Emitted when a object occur in the stream which also are in the array of objects
compared against but they differ from each other.

```js
compare.on('change', function (streamObj, compareObj) {
    console.log('changed', streamObj, compareObj);
});
```


### delete

Emitted on objects which are in the array of objects compared against but not in
the stream.

```js
compare.on('delete', function (obj) {
    console.log('deleted', obj);
});
```


### equal

Emitted for objects in the stream which are equal in the array of objects
compared against.

```js
compare.on('equal', function (streamObj, compareObj) {
    console.log('equal', streamObj, compareObj);
});
```



## node.js compabillity

This module use some native ES6 functions only found in node.js 4.x and newer. 
This module will not function with older than 4.x versions of node.js.



## error handling

This module does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on 
whatever streams you pipe into this module. This is a general rule when 
programming with node.js streams: always handle errors on each and every stream. 

We recommend using [`end-of-stream`](https://npmjs.org/end-of-stream) or [`pump`](https://npmjs.org/pump) 
for writing error tolerant stream code.
